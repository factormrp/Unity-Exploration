5 May 2020:

Found video series titled "Intro to Game Development
(Unity and C#)" on YouTube that I will use as a basis
for jumpstarting my journey.

To log specific skills/concepts learned, I created a 
notes file

Walked through first nine videos, learning about movement and vector structs

1st Commit: Added all files from first learning game to remote repo
