5 May 2020:

Found video series titled "Intro to Game Development (Unity and C#)" on YouTube that I will use as a basis for jumpstarting my journey.

To log specific skills/concepts learned, I created a notes file

Walked through first nine videos, learning about movement and vector structs

The Vector structs are likely implemented using linked lists as they are heap generated.

Interestingly, the C# compiler or Unity comes with a garbage collector, so new commands are not paired with deletes


1st Commit: Added all files from first learning game to remote repo



9 May 2020:

Continued watching the video series, completing videos 10-12.

Researched Oculus Rift controller input documentation to get an understanding for the inputs I have available to me when I choose to implement my first VR game.

Learned about FixedUpdate and GetComponent among other things

Object collision is very fascinating to me because it uses physics components (likely implemented as functions) to calculate intersections b/w objects and then
trigger event listeners that themselves call on functions to carry out set instructions


2nd Commit: Added work completed 



15 May 2020:

Continued video series, completing videos 13-14.

Learned about 2D creation, accessing camera components, and more random generation.

Noted that the majority of the work usually taken on by loops gets passed on to update and that control flow is not as common due to the accessibility of
a huge library of premade event listeners and other such control flow mechanics


3rd Commit: Added work completed



19 May 2020:

Continued work on falling objects game from last time and completed it.

Learned about alot more functionality including a possible way to make customizable event listeners

Leveraged Mathf formulas to add incremental mechanics relying on the update function for looped flow


Restructured notes from chronological order to a segmented order for better reference and usability

4th commit: Added work completed, including a first working game not meant for basic skills training
