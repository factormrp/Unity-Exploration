5 May 2020:

Found video series titled "Intro to Game Development
(Unity and C#)" on YouTube that I will use as a basis
for jumpstarting my journey.

To log specific skills/concepts learned, I created a 
notes file

Walked through first nine videos, learning about movement and vector structs
The Vector structs are likely implemented using linked lists as they are heap
generated.

Interestingly, the C# compiler or Unity comes with a garbage collector, so new commands
are not paired with deletes

1st Commit: Added all files from first learning game to remote repo

Continued watching the video series, completing videos 10-12.

Researched Oculus Rift controller input documentation to get an understanding for the
inputs I have available to me when I choose to implement my first VR game.

Learned about FixedUpdate and GetComponent.

2nd Commit: Added work completed
