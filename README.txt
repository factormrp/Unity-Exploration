5 May 2020:

Found video series titled "Intro to Game Development
(Unity and C#)" on YouTube that I will use as a basis
for jumpstarting my journey.

To log specific skills/concepts learned, I created a 
notes file

Walked through first nine videos, learning about movement and vector structs

1st Commit: Added all files from first learning game to remote repo



9 May 2020:

Continued watching the video series, completing videos 10-12.

Researched Oculus Rift controller input documentation to get an understanding for the
inputs I have available to me when I choose to implement my first VR game.
